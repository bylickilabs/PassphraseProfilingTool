Passphrase Profiling Tool is a privacy-friendly web application for analyzing and evaluating user passphrases.

It identifies behavioral patterns in password creation, such as repeated use of years, predictable keyboard sequences, or structural similarities.

The tool calculates entropy, checks for uppercase/lowercase letters, digits, symbols, and flags weak or common patterns.
Additionally, it generates an anonymous JSON-based profile that can be used for further evaluation or risk scoring.

Typical use cases include:
- Security awareness training and password workshops
- Forensic password pattern analysis in controlled environments
- Internal quality assurance in IT security departments
