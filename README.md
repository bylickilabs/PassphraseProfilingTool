It identifies behavioral patterns in password creation, such as repeated use of years, predictable keyboard sequences, or structural similarities.

The tool calculates entropy, checks for uppercase/lowercase letters, digits, symbols, and flags weak or common patterns.
Additionally, it generates an anonymous JSON-based profile that can be used for further evaluation or risk scoring.

Typical use cases include:
- Security awareness training and password workshops
- Forensic password pattern analysis in controlled environments
- Internal quality assurance in IT security departments
